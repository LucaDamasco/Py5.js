# Py5.js
This is currently an experiment to create a python version of the P5.js library.

Python is an incredibly popular language for computer science education instruction. Creating a simple way to create media rich projects, in the style of Processing and P5.js with Python, seems like a valuable pursuit. Using P5.js allows theseprojects to be shared widely across the web, without the restriction of the current Processing.py/Jython implementation library.

At the recent "Learn to Teach, Teach to Learn" conference, held by the School for Poetic Computation at UCLA, a discussion topic centered around "Creative way to use Python" in the classroom. This need was brought up by an educator who found many of her students (K-12) had received Python training at bootcamps, summer camps, and other out-of-school activities.

The project will start with an extension of the expreimentation seen on a google groups discussion by Alexandre Villares.
